# forge-signal-wasm Documentation

These docs are organized by product layer, not by filename history.

Start with the short learning path when you are new. Use `resources/` for
ordinary route-first API work, `forms/` for the shipped forms surface,
`resource-contracts/` when you need the proof and delivery rules underneath
resource behavior, `api-reference/` for exact surfaces, and `app-surface/` for
the broader signal app model.
